Cut the original audio into more granular files with new names,
saving the cut specifications in text files so you can edit your cuts.

Run like so. ::

    cutaudio 'audio/long raw audio file.mp3' 'another file.wav'

The following happens to each audio file that you pass.

1. If a cut file does not exist alongside the original file,
   play the file and prompt for cuts. Cuts are saved to the cutfile.
2. If an output directory does not exist alongside the original file,
   process the cut file to produce the output directory.

Step 1 depends on mplayer, and step 2 depends on sox.

Install from PyPI. ::
